# Leah Cardoz's Personal Website

Welcome to my new and improved personal website built with ReactJS. 

Please note this is still a work in progress!

<!-- TO DO:
- make entire app responsive/centered - try grid on portfolio page so that card size is responsive?
- make footer white with color icons?
- test contrast / find a better color palette for website
- add shadows/borders/gradients to create depth/dimension?
- make sure fonts (style, weight, size, color etc), colors, hover effects, link effects, spacing (margin, padding, width/height) are all uniform
